# Implementing Core Mobile Development Modules with React Native
1. Setting Up a Multi-Flavored App
Create a React Native project with two flavors: dev and prod.
Configure different app names, icons, and package names for each flavor.
Ensure that each flavor uses its respective Firebase project.


2. Firebase Integration per Flavor
Add Firebase to the project and configure it differently for dev and prod.
Implement Firebase authentication using email/password and Google Sign-In.
Store user details in Firestore.


3. Implementing Social Logins
Integrate Google, Apple, and Facebook logins using Firebase Auth.
Ensure that users can sign in and out and their session persists after app restart.


4. Push Notifications
Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications.
Configure push notifications to work differently for dev and prod flavors.
Implement Revopush to handle over the air updates.


5. Implementing Deep Linking
Set up deep linking in the project for both Android and iOS.
Create deep links to navigate to specific screens based on URL parameters.
Ensure deep links work even when the app is killed.
Setup both universal and uri-scheme deeplinking



6. Handling App Permissions
Request permissions for camera, location, and push notifications.
Implement proper permission handling for both Android and iOS.


7. Offline-First App Architecture
Implement local data caching using Realm.
Show cached data when offline and sync it when the user goes online.


8. Building & Distributing the App
Generate an APK and AAB for Android.
Generate an IPA for iOS and distribute via TestFlight.


9. Secure Storage & Authentication
Implement secure storage for user tokens
Ensure tokens are properly handled across app restarts.


10. Revopush
Implement code push using Revopush for both dev and prod.
Show an update prompt when a new code push is available.
